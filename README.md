Tracks PvP performance by keeping track of various stats. Only useful for 1v1 PvP fights that involve overhead prayers and/or gear switching, Last Man Standing & PvP arena "NHing" being the perfect examples. Multi will cause problems. **Potentially inaccurate:** there are some imperfections and assumptions in this plugin, but it is generally accurate for most popular gear setups & spec weapons. 

This plugin was created with significant help from [Mazhar, @maz_rs](https://twitter.com/maz_rs) - notably for the idea & implementation of deserved damage, as well as a few other helpful suggestions & fixes.

Massive thanks to [all other contributors](https://github.com/Matsyir/pvp-performance-tracker/graphs/contributors) as well! No matter how big or small your contribution, this plugin wouldn't be where it is today without everyone's help.

-------------------------------
I am happy to see other features/stats come into this plugin in the future, feel free to submit issues/suggestions & PRs. If you find a weapon that doesn't work, let me know as well.

Note that I'm not very active on RS lately myself, so this project is not among my highest priorities - but I'm happy to keep supporting it, especially for issues that affect most users, with normal gear setups in places like LMS or PvP Arena. In other words, the plugin is sort of "on life support" when it comes to the work I'm putting into it, but glad to keep managing it if others want to contribute.
