Tracks PvP performance by keeping track of various stats. Only useful for 1v1 PvP fights that involve overhead prayers and/or gear switching, Last Man Standing being the perfect example. Multi will cause problems. **Potentially inaccurate:** there are some imperfections and assumptions in this plugin, but it is generally accurate for most popular gear setups & spec weapons. 

This plugin was created in collaboration with [Mazhar, @maz_rs](https://twitter.com/maz_rs).

-------------------------------
I am happy to see other features/stats come into this plugin in the future, feel free to submit issues/suggestions & PRs. If you find a weapon that doesn't work, let me know as well.

Note that I'm not very active on RS lately myself, so this project is not among my highest priorities - but I'm happy to keep supporting it, especially for significant issues that may affect most average users with average gear setups in places like LMS. In other words, the plugin is basically "on life support" when it comes to the work I'm putting into it, but happy to keep managing it if others want to contribute.
