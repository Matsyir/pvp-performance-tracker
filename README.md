# PvP Performance Tracker

External Plugin for [RuneLite](https://github.com/runelite/runelite), a third-party OldSchool Runescape client.

Tracks PvP performance by keeping track of various stats. Only useful for 1v1 PvP fights that involve overhead prayers and/or gear switching, Last Man Standing being the perfect example. Multi will cause problems. Potentially inaccurate outside of LMS. 

This plugin was created in collaboration with [Mazhar, @maz_rs on twitter](https://twitter.com/maz_rs) ([@voiderman1337](https://github.com/voiderman1337)).
